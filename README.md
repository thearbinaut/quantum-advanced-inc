# Quantum Advanced Inc.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for Quantum Advanced Inc., a cutting-edge quantum computing and DeFi company.

## Project Structure

- `src/control_room/`: Contains the main application code
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `marketing/`: Marketing materials

## Features

1. User authentication with secure password hashing
2. Quantum computing demos:
   - Basic quantum circuit
   - Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
   - Grover's algorithm
3. Machine Learning integration with quantum data
4. Blockchain integration for storing quantum computation results
5. Data visualization of quantum results using Chart.js
6. Monitoring and logging with Flask-MonitoringDashboard
7. CSRF protection and secure headers
8. Dockerized application for easy deployment
9. CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
10. Serverless deployment configuration for AWS Lambda

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python src/control_room/app.py`

## Docker Development

1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t quantum-advanced-inc .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 quantum-advanced-inc`

## Deployment Options

1. Heroku: Use the provided Procfile
2. AWS Lambda: Use the serverless.yml configuration with Serverless Framework
3. Any WSGI-compatible server: Use the wsgi.py file

## CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml` handles continuous integration and deployment.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- CSRF protection is enabled
- Secure headers are set using Flask-Talisman

## Blockchain Integration

Quantum computation results are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Make sure to set up your own Ethereum node or use a service like Infura, and replace the placeholder values in the code with your own Ethereum account and private key.

## Machine Learning

A Random Forest Classifier is used to classify quantum states generated by random quantum circuits. This demonstrates the potential for combining classical machine learning techniques with quantum data.

## Monitoring

Flask-MonitoringDashboard is integrated to provide insights into the application's performance and usage.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more advanced quantum algorithms
2. Enhance the machine learning model and explore quantum machine learning techniques
3. Develop a more sophisticated blockchain integration, possibly implementing a custom smart contract
4. Add user management features (registration, password reset, etc.)
5. Implement more comprehensive error handling and logging
6. Enhance the frontend with a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js
